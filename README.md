Quinn is an implementation of the [QUIC][quic] protocol based on futures.
It is currently in its very early stages: work is ongoing on implementing
the protocol handshake for both client and server.

Quinn is the subject of a [RustFest Paris (May 2018) presentation][talk].

All feedback welcome. Feel free to file bugs, requests for documentation and
any other feedback to the [issue tracker][issues] or [tweet me][twitter].

# Features

* Currently targets QUIC draft 11 and TLS 1.3 draft 28
* Uses [rustls][rustls] for all TLS operations
* Uses [*ring*][ring] for AEAD encryption/decryption
